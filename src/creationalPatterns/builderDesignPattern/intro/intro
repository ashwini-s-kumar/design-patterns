The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a
complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
The main idea behind the Builder pattern is to provide a flexible way to create objects without requiring knowledge
 of the underlying implementation.

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

In the Builder pattern, a separate object, called the builder, is responsible for constructing the object.
The builder typically provides a set of methods for configuring the object being built,
which allows the client to specify the desired properties of the object. Once the client
has finished configuring the builder, the builder creates the object and returns it to the client.

One of the key benefits of the Builder pattern is that it provides a way to create complex objects with a simple,
 step-by-step process. This makes it easier to understand and modify the construction process,
 as well as enabling the creation of multiple variations of the same object.

Overall, the Builder pattern can be a useful tool for creating complex objects in a flexible and easy-to-understand way,
particularly when the underlying implementation is complex or subject to change.
