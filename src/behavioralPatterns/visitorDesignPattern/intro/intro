The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add
new operations or behaviors to an existing class hierarchy without modifying the
classes themselves. It separates the algorithm or logic from the object structure
on which it operates.

In this pattern, a visitor object is created that visits or traverses each object
in the object structure and performs the desired operation on it. The object
structure can be any complex data structure, such as a tree or a graph, and
the operations can be anything that can be performed on the objects, such as
 calculating a value, validating a property, or updating a state.

The Visitor pattern is composed of the following main elements:

Visitor: The interface or abstract class that declares the methods for each operation
    or behavior that can be performed on the objects in the object structure.

ConcreteVisitor: The concrete implementation of the Visitor interface that defines the
    actual behavior of each operation or behavior.

Element: The interface or abstract class that defines the methods that allow the Visitor
    to access and operate on the objects in the object structure.

ConcreteElement: The concrete implementation of the Element interface that defines the
    actual objects in the object structure.

ObjectStructure: The collection of objects that are to be operated on by the Visitor.

The Visitor pattern provides a flexible way to add new behaviors to an object hierarchy
        without modifying the existing code. It is particularly useful when dealing with
        complex object structures where the behavior of each object depends on its type
        and state. However, it can also lead to a complex and hard-to-maintain code if not
        used carefully.
