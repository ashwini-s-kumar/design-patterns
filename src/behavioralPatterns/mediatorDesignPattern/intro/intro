The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to communicate with each
    other without directly interacting with each other. Instead, they communicate through a mediator object
    that controls the communication between them. This reduces the coupling between objects and makes it
    easier to change the way they communicate.

The Mediator design pattern has the following components:

Mediator: Defines the interface for communication between colleague objects. It knows about all the
    colleagues and how to communicate with them.

Concrete Mediator: Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleagues.
    It maintains references to all the colleagues and facilitates communication between them.

Colleague: Defines the interface for communication with the mediator. Colleagues know about the mediator
    and communicate with it when they need to send or receive messages.

Concrete Colleague: Implements the Colleague interface and communicates with the mediator to send or
    receive messages. Concrete colleagues are aware of the mediator and can communicate with other
    colleagues indirectly through it.
